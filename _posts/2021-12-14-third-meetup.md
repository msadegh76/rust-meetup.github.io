## Event

This is the third Rust Iran meetup and it's online due to the Covid-19
pandemic.

Bring your ideas, questions & projects:
- What did you work on this week?
- What problems did you solve this week with Rust?
- Are you just learning Rust and want some topic explained?
- Found an interesting crate you want to talk about?

Want to present something in the next meetup? mail me at kaveh at
